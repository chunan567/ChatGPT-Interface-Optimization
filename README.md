# ChatGPT Interface Optimization

This user script provides options to customize the interface of OpenAI's ChatGPT platform.

## Features

1. Customizable text box height, input box width, and chat window width.
2. Shortcut keys for hiding the sidebar.
3. Options to hide the bottom disclaimer and the thumbs up/down feedback buttons.

## Installation

1. Install a user script manager. This script is tested with Tampermonkey, but it should work with others as well.
2. Visit the [GreasyFork page](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/467789-chatgpt-%E7%95%8C%E9%9D%A2%E4%BC%98%E5%8C%96) of this script and click on the "Install this script" button.

## Usage

After installing the script, visit the ChatGPT platform. You will find a new settings menu where you can adjust the user interface according to your preferences.

## Note

!!!Please note: This script provides the option to hide the bottom disclaimer and feedback buttons, but this may not comply with OpenAI's terms of use. Users should understand the importance of these two features: the disclaimer is an important information prompt for users, and the feedback button is an important tool to help OpenAI collect and improve ChatGPT. Therefore, if you choose to use this script, we recommend that you keep these two features.
